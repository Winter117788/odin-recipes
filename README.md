# Odin Recipes Project

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum. It demonstrates my ability to create a simple webpage structure using HTML, organize content, and use basic Git workflow to manage version control.

Once completed, I will have showcased my skills in:
- Creating structured HTML files
- Using links to connect different pages
- Basic Git commands such as add, commit, push, and clone
